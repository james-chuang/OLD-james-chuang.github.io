# My github page, [james-chuang.github.io](https://james-chuang.github.io/)

A place to post my work as I learn statistics, machine learning, and data science. Site implemented using [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) with a modified version of the [accent](https://github.com/bk2dcradle/accent) theme. Uses [rmarkdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) to generate content. It's a work in progress.

## some resources I am currently working through

- [The Elements of Statistical Learning](http://statweb.stanford.edu/~tibs/ElemStatLearn/)
- [Stanford CS229 Machine Learning Notes](http://cs229.stanford.edu/materials.html)
- [The Deep Learning Book](http://www.deeplearningbook.org/)
