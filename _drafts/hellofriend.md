Hello friend,

It's a strange time in my life right now, though I guess the same is true for everyone these days. Three months ago I started treatment for social anxiety and depression. They've been with me for as long as I can remember, but over the last ten years things have progressed to the point where they completely control me.

The most hollow feeling is being surrounded by friends or people you want to get to know and being paralyzed because your subconscious is screaming to run away and save yourself. When this happens over and over and over, it's only natural to start avoiding people. I tried to accept it and live while minimizing human interaction --after all, you're supposed to 'be yourself'--, and things were almost fine except for the inconvenient fact that the circuit in my brain for feeling loneliness works just fine.

The cycle goes like this (for a python implementation, click here!):

1. Attempt normal social interaction to fight loneliness.
2. This causes nothing but anxiety. Hate yourself and sink further into depression.
3. Isolate yourself to avoid further anxiety.
4. Feel lonely because you isolated yourself. Sink further into depression. Go to step 1.

It's not sustainable. To save itself, my brain started shutting down. I gradually stopped being able to feel anything, which is liberating at first when all you've been feeling is loneliness and anxiety. But other systems started to shut down as well. Eventually my thinking slowed to where I had trouble holding coherent ideas in my head, and finishing a complete sentence took extreme effort.

I self-medicated by running, up to a hundred miles a week. I didn't admit it to myself at the time, but instead of running because I enjoyed it like I used to, I was now doing it because it was the only way I could lift the mental fog for an hour or two each day. In retrospect, it's probably lucky I chose running to be addicted to. The two times in my life I've felt completely at peace were both when I was in the hospital hopped up on whatever morphine analog they gave me before surgery. I crave that sometimes, but opiates are a slippery slope...

These changes happened so slowly that I didn't realize anything was wrong for the longest time. A few things happened to change this. I went on a hiking trip in Colorado. Surrounded by friends in the mountains, my brain even in its crippled state lit up for a brief instant with an unfamiliar feeling. Later I realized the feeling was something like happiness. Terrifying. How could I forget the feeling of happiness? Forget happiness, when was the last time I felt any emotion at all?

A few weeks later I went to race a marathon. The marathon is special because it's the first regular race distance where fuel matters. At some point during the race, most people will deplete their body's stored carbohydrates. When I reached that point, suddenly my brain didn't have the energy to power all of the mental gymnastics I had unconsciously been doing to convince myself that I was 'okay'. I ended up lying in the grass at the side of the road, staring at up at the clouds with my first clear thought in months: If nothing changes soon, I am going to die.

At the lowest point, I mean it when I say I wasn't suicidal. I simply didn't have the energy for that. I just thought that it wouldn't be so bad if I could somehow disappear with no one noticing. I only realized that this might not be a normal thing to think during my entry interview at student health services (the look on the poor guy's face! I really didn't mean to traumatize you like that...).

The past few weeks have been interesting, to say the least. With medication and therapy, my brain is slowly starting to reboot. I can think again, and emotions are slowly coming back online one by one. I can tell you exactly the first time I found something funny (I wish I could say it was something highbrow, but it was this gif. I was so overwhelmed by the ability to find things funny that I laid on the floor laughing for twenty minutes.). The feelings of sadness and loneliness have also returned. When they return, they return intensely, as if my brain is making up for lost time. I haven't rediscovered anger yet, but when I do, it would probably be best if everyone in a five mile radius took cover.

Now that I can feel again, I'm painfully aware of how easy it would be to slip back into another destructive cycle. The medication dulls the anxiety, but I've already missed years of normal life. So much of my personality was a product of trying to convince myself and everyone around me that I was okay that I'm not quite sure who I am anymore. But, I'm strangely hopeful. I've discovered that there are amazing people in my life who haven't given up on me even after I gave up on myself. The least I can do to for them is to try.

I wish I was the only one out there fighting a battle for their mental health, but I know I'm not that special. Does it ever get better? I don't know yet, but I hope we can find out together.
